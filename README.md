# Neal.Fun Stimulation Clicker Auto-clicker

I did this because I was bored.


## autoclick.py
This script is meant to auto-play this link: https://neal.fun/stimulation-clicker/

The idea would be that the browser is opened on the left side of the screen, and the console running this script is on the right side of the screen.

The position constants for PyAutoGUI are so that it'd auto click the upgrades and the click-me button, and then every once in awhile, switch back to the console so that the script would only play if it sees the next Enter key, like a dead man's switch.

If I ever let go of the Enter key, the script would stop on its own.
